# Download all images from Newgrounds forum user / Download all files from website that are from X server
## Overview:

Automatically extracts the facial flex poses from a DMX model into seperate .obj files. So you can then use them in your custom animation packages such as 3ds Max.

The script basically works like this:
Checks a html page for if a link points to a server of interest, if it does, download that file.
If the pages are numbered, you can assign how many loops to go through. Or you can use it to check a .txt file that contains a list of URLs to check.


## Usage
1. Download both EXE's from the Compiled folder
2. Run Dmx2Flex.exe
3. Adjust the "User vars" section to suit your needs.
4. Optionally: comment out the "Looping page count" section and uncomment "Loop through .txt file" section, depending on your needs.
